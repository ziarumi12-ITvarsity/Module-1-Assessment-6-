            <td>Here are some adjectives for carnation: flippantly red, white and richest, scandalous red, lavender, seductive, solitary pink, telltale and uncontrollable, striped, refusal, pure and animated, wilted and disreputable, newly potted, rare indigenous, incarnatum_â€”annual, dusky, dark, delightfully scented.</td>
            <td>The carnation means fascination, distinction, and love. According to a Christian legend, carnations grew from the Virgin Mary's tears as she watched Jesus carry the cross. This is how they became associated with motherly love.</td>
            <td>Most other species in the genus Dianthus are known as pinks. Of the several kinds of carnations, the three most common are annual, border, and perpetual- flowering carnations (see Figure 1). Border carnations are the oldest form of carnation still in cultivation.</td>
