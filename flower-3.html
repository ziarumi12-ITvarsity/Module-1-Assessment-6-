            <td>They grow from small tubers planted in the spring. Picking a favorite dahlia is like going through a button box. As well as coming in a rainbow of colors, dahlia flowers can range in size from petite 2-inch lollipop-style pompoms to giant 15-inch “dinner plate” blooms. Most varieties grow 4 to 5 feet tall.</td>
            <td>The petals are often overlapping and curled for most of their length. Collarette dahlias have one row of flat petals surrounding a disc as well as an inner wreath of shorter petals called the 'collar'. Ball and Pompon dahlias are shaped like balls and feature double flowers with rounded or blunt tipped florets.</td>
            <td>Because dahlias belong to the Composite family and because some dahlia floral forms, such as orchids, mignon singles, singles, and collarettes create capitulums with eight ray florets, or eight 'petals', it was hypothesized that other dahlia varieties might also have floret counts following the Fibonacci sequence.</td>
