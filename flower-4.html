    <h2>Orchid</h2>
    <p>The orchid flower, like most flowers of monocots, has two whorls of sterile elements. The outer whorl has three sepals and the inner whorl has three petals. The sepals are usually very similar to the petals (thus called tepals, 1), but may be completely distinct.</p>

            <td>If you do not have the original tag identifying the orchid, then the easiest way to identify it is with the flowers. Look at the shape, color, patterns, and size of the bloom. Most orchids come in many colors, so you cannot identify an orchid solely by the color or size of the flower, but it may help narrow it down.</td>
            <td>Due to their namesake, orchids are associated with fertility, virility, and sexuality. These associations, coupled with their exotic appearance, have given them a long history of being associated with love, fertility and elegance throughout various cultures and time periods.</td>
