            <td>They stand tall and proud; they are colorful and jubilant. Mother Nature's children, so innocent and fragile. At night they close their petals to get a good night's sleep; in the morning they awaken, bright and ready.” Caitlyn Haley: “Tulips open slowly, like people gradually come out of their shells .</td>
            <td>Tulips are known for their bold colors and beautiful shape, and most varieties are indeed almost perfectly symmetrical.

            <td>Tulip flowers may be single, double, ruffled, fringed, or lily-shaped, depending on the variety. Wild—or “Species”—tulips are small in size, ranging in height from 3 to 8 inches. They are tougher than hybrids. They also bloom in the South and look best when planted as a carpet of color.</td>
